Designing the architecture (Mockup Project) for a complex system like a property management system (PMS) with a Work Order module and integration with ChatGPT involves multiple components and tools. Below is an architecture diagram outlining the high-level components and their interactions. Please note that this is a simplified representation, and the actual architecture may vary based on specific requirements and technologies.

Components and Tools:

1. Client Applications:

These can be web-based, mobile apps, or desktop applications used by hotel staff, guests, and supervisors to interact with the PMS.
Examples: Web browsers, mobile app frameworks (React Native, Flutter).

2. FastAPI Application:

The core of the PMS system, implemented using FastAPI to create RESTful APIs for various modules.
Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and routes requests to appropriate modules.
Examples: Python, FastAPI.

3. Work Order Module:

Manages work orders for the hotel, including creation, updating, and tracking.
Utilizes a database for storing work order data.
Provides RESTful APIs for work order management.
Examples: PostgreSQL (for database), SQLAlchemy (Python ORM).

4. ChatGPT Integration:

Integrates ChatGPT for providing recommendations and responses.
Communicates with the ChatGPT API to generate text-based responses.
Examples: OpenAI GPT-3 API.

5. Authentication & Authorization:

Manages user authentication and authorization for API access.
Grants access tokens to client applications.
Examples: OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

6. Database Management:

Stores structured data, including work orders, user information, and system data.
Ensures data integrity, scalability, and backup/recovery.
Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB (for analytical data).

7. Background Services:

Runs background tasks and services for automated processes (e.g., sending notifications, processing work orders).
Ensures asynchronous processing for improved system responsiveness.
Examples: Celery (task queue), Redis (message broker).

8. Logging & Monitoring:

Captures system logs and metrics for monitoring and debugging.
Provides insights into system performance and errors.
Examples: Loguru (Python logging library), Prometheus, Grafana.

9. Analytics Module (Optional):

Processes work order data for generating reports and insights.
Prepares data for visualization on management dashboards.
Examples: Business Intelligence tools (Tableau, Power BI), data pipelines (Apache Kafka, Apache Spark).

10. Cloud Services (Optional):

Hosts the PMS system on cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
Provides services like load balancing, auto-scaling, and data storage.
Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

11. External APIs (Optional):

Integrates with external services for additional functionality (e.g., weather data, inventory management).
Communicates with third-party APIs using REST or GraphQL.
Examples: Weather APIs, Payment gateways.

12. Containers & Orchestration (Optional):

Uses containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for easy deployment and management of services.
Ensures scalability and high availability.
Examples: Docker, Kubernetes.

13. Security & Compliance:

Implements security measures like encryption, access control, and data protection to ensure compliance with regulations.
Examples: TLS/SSL, role-based access control (RBAC), GDPR compliance.

14. Documentation & Testing:

Maintains comprehensive documentation for APIs, architecture, and codebase.
Conducts unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure system reliability.
Examples: Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman, pytest.

15. CI/CD Pipeline (Optional):

Implements a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Examples: Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD.
